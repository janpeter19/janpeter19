- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @janpeter19
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications, see
[paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378889007_Design_ideas_behind_Bioprocess_Library_for_Modelica).
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab. I have prepared several 
[examples](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Examples_used.md)
for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch. Here you follow a Jupyter notebook and can continue interact using Python and modifiy the simulations and graphs shown. More about the technology used
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Technology_used.md) and about the modelling 
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Modelling_used.md).
No installation needed!

   Google Colab major 
   [announcements](https://medium.com/google-colab) and the technical
   [release-notes](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/relnotes.ipynb).

  **Note 2025-08-04** All applications run with BPL 2.3.1 with MSL 4.1.0, using PyFMI 2.18.0 or FMPy 0.3.25. However, here are three applications that needs the older FMPy 0.3.21 and I will take a dialogue with the vendor. In the near future Colab is expected to upgrade default Ubuntu to 24.04 and may call for recompilations of the FMUs from my side. 


  **Note 2025-03-27** Recently i have made some new bioprocess examples and updated some old, within the current notebooks.

  * BPL\_YEAST\_AIR\_Fedbatch - Here is now a section illustrating the impact of low dissolved oxygen levels in a homogenous bioreactor. 
    This subject is important for understanding scale-up but clear-cut simple dynamic experiments in the lab scale are difficult to find. 
    Instead people in the 80s and 90s focused on the more complicated two-reactor setups. These experiments are the focus of a notebook to 
    be made, before long.

  * BPL\_CHO\_Fedbatch - The model is updated and includes a state for lysed cell mass and the toxic impact that material may have on 
    specific growth rate. Now the simulations can capture the decline of viable cell mass during later part of cultivation often found.

  * BPL\_CHO\_Perfusion\_cspr - This model is also updated and includes a state for lysed cell mass and toxic impact that the material may 
    have. The phenomena is however not yet illustrated in this notebook, but the model is there. Try yourself!

  Further, the PDF-version of notebooks have been updated and corrected and now truncation has been eliminated. Each notebook has been 
  locally printed to a PDF using the package `nbconvert` together with `MikTex` in a Windows environment.

   Earlier notes you find [here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Notes.md).

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking forward to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Modelica in Colab. I also tailor-make models of biotechnical processes for your needs on a consultancy basis. Work with processes involves broader data analysis and is a part of my work, and simulation is just one tool, but an important one. Digital Twins is a catchword these days and part of what I do.
