- 👋 Hi, I’m @janpeter19
- 👀 I’m interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab and I have prepared several examples for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Colab.
- 📫 You can reach me at: jan.peter.axelsson@vascaia.se
