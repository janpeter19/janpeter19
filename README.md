- 👋 Hi, I’m @janpeter19
- 👀 I’m interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications, see
[paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378889007_Design_ideas_behind_Bioprocess_Library_for_Modelica).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab. I have prepared several 
[examples](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Examples_used.md)
for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch. Here you follow a Jupyter notebook and can continue interact using Python and modifiy the simulations and graphs shown. More about the technology used
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Technology_used.md) and about the modelling 
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Modelling_used.md).
No installation needed! 

  **Note 2024-10-04**
  The GUI for BPL ver 2.2.1 is an update with minor adjustments after now longer time usage.

  Further, the possibility to simulate, change a parameter, and then continue simulation using the command simu('cont'), now finally works also for OpenModelica Linux FMUs, see their Github-list of issues #12561.  The command is part of the simplified interface FMU-explore for the packages PyFMI and FMPy. 

  OpenModelica nightly build 1.25.0-dev after 2024-10-02 is now used throughout for running notebooks in Google Colab.

  Earlier notes you find [here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Notes.md).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Modelica in Colab. I also tailor-make models of biotechnical processes for your needs on a consultancy basis. Work with processes involves broader data analysis and is a part of my work, and simulation is just one tool, but an important one. Digital Twins is a catchword these days and part of what I do.
