- 👋 Hi, I’m @janpeter19
- 👀 I’m interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications, see
[paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378889007_Design_ideas_behind_Bioprocess_Library_for_Modelica).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab. I have prepared several 
[examples](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Examples_used.md)
for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch. Here you follow a Jupyter notebook and can continue interact using Python and modifiy the simulations and graphs shown. More about the technology used
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Technology_used.md) and about the modelling 
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Modelling_used.md).
No installation needed! 

  **Note 2024-07-20**
  The GUI for BPL has now reached an important milestone and all applications can be GUI-configured and the notebooks include corresponding process diagram. The models and results are the same, of course. Recent GUI work:

  * An example of fedbatch cultivation of yeast with control of dissolved oxygen (now also including icons for the gasphase) - see repository BPL\_YEAST\_AIR\_Fedbatch

  * An example pf ion exchange chromotagraphy - see repositories BPL\_IEC\_validation (but BPL\_IEC\_operation needs a fix around scale_volume, i.e. scaling of the time axis).

  OpenModelica 1.23.1 was used. In the fall a subset of GUI for the liquid phase only was validated with Impact 2.1 

  The issue #12561 with the OpenModelica FMUs still remains, and a new for FMPy #679.

  Earlier notes you find [here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Notes.md).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Modelica in Colab. I also tailor-make models of biotechnical processes for your needs on a consultancy basis. Work with processes involves broader data analysis and is a part of my work, and simulation is just one tool, but an important one. Digital Twins is a catchword these days and part of what I do.
