- 👋 Hi, I’m @janpeter19
- 👀 I’m interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab. I have prepared several 
[examples](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Examples_used.md)
for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch. Here you follow a Jupyter notebook and can continue interact using Python and modifiy the simulations and graphs shown. More about the technology used
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Technology_used.md) and about the modelling 
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Modelling_used.md).
No installation needed! 

- **Note 2023-03-16** The Google Colab VM has for a week problem with the package PyFMI. You can look at the PDF of the notebooks though. For the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch_calibration the notebook can be run with the alternative package that is for evaluation. Earlier notes you find [here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Notes.md).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Colab. I also tailor-make models of biotechnical processes for your needs on a consultancey basis. Digital Twins is a catchword these days and that is what I do!
