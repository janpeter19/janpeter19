- 👋 Hi, I’m @janpeter19
- 👀 I’m interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab. I have prepared several 
[examples](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Examples_used.md)
for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch. Here you follow a Jupyter notebook and can continue interact using Python and modifiy the simulations and graphs shown. More about the technology used
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Technology_used.md) and about the modelling 
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Modelling_used.md).
No installation needed! 

- **Note 2023-09-26**
I would like to draw your attention to two conference contributions recently and examples represented in the repositories. Here will be some further updates in the coming days.
**CONF\_2023\_08\_NPCW24** - The example on ion chromatography was presented that we have worked on for some time. **CONF\_2023\_10\_MODELICA15**  - The design ideas behind BPL is presented with focus on the library structure. A few basic examples are used for illustration and found here.
Now PyFMI works as usual again after adjustments in the package environment. And you also alternatively can use FMPy as before.
Earlier notes you find [here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Notes.md).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Modelica in Colab. I also tailor-make models of biotechnical processes for your needs on a consultancy basis. Work with processes involves broader data analysis and is a part of my work, and simulation is just one tool, but an important one. Digital Twins is a catchword these days and part of what I do.
