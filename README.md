- 👋 Hi, I’m @janpeter19
- 👀 I’m interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab. I have prepared several examples for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch. Here you follow a Jupyter notebook and can continue interact using Python and modifiy the simulations and graphs shown. More about the technology used
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Technology_used.md) and about the modelling 
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Modelling_used.md).
No installation needed! 

- **Note** Just before Christmas there was some change in the "Conda/Python universe" that make my colab-scripts not work anymore. I will try to fix it during January. I the meantime you can look at the PDF-version of the notebooks. If you badly want to run notebooks, send me a mail and I can help you with a local Linux installation.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Colab. I also tailor-make models of biotechnical processes for your needs on a consultancey basis.
