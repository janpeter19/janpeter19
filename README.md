- 👋 Hi, I’m @janpeter19
- 👀 I’m interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab. I have prepared several 
[examples](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Examples_used.md)
for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch. Here you follow a Jupyter notebook and can continue interact using Python and modifiy the simulations and graphs shown. More about the technology used
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Technology_used.md) and about the modelling 
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Modelling_used.md).
No installation needed! 

- **Note** The Google Colab VM has in mid January been updated to Ubuntu 20.04 and runs now Python 3.8 and enables us to use the latest version of the key package PyFMI.  This is all good news! However, the old notebooks and files must be updated to work. I will update the scripts, the compiled FMUs, and the notebooks slightly.  I have started with BPL_TEST2_Batch and will go through the repositories one by one.  For repositories not yet updated you can always look at the PDF-version of the notebooks. To see  which repositories that are updated you take a look at the brief description of the repositories and ends with "Updated".

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Colab. I also tailor-make models of biotechnical processes for your needs on a consultancey basis. Digital Twins is a catchword these days and that is what I do!
