- 👋 Hi, I’m @janpeter19
- 👀 I’m interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab. I have prepared several examples for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch. Here you follow a Jupyter notebook and can continue interact using Python and modifiy the simulations and graphs shown. More about the technology used [here](https://github.com/janpeter19/blob/Technology_used.md). No installation needed! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Colab. I also tailor-make models of biotechnical processes for your needs on a consultancey basis.
- 📫 You can reach me at: jan.peter.axelsson@vascaia.se
