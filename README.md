- 👋 Hi, I’m @janpeter19
- 👀 I’m interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab. I have prepared several 
[examples](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Examples_used.md)
for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch. Here you follow a Jupyter notebook and can continue interact using Python and modifiy the simulations and graphs shown. More about the technology used
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Technology_used.md) and about the modelling 
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Modelling_used.md).
No installation needed! 

- **Note 2023-06-01** Now the setup scripts using PyFMI works again. They have been updated for Python 3.10 that is now default version for Colab VM since a few weeks. The scripts for FMPy are more robust. Further here are a few new repositories with preliminary notebooks:
*    BPL_YEAST_COB_Batch - illustrate constraint-based modelling and simulation with FMU and Optlang in combination.
*    BPL_IEC_operation - show downstream ion exchange chromatography in operation in several typical situations 
*    BPL_IEC_validation - show downstrean ion exchange chromatograph show similarity with original work
     
* These notebooks show something of the width of using Bioprocess Library framework for simulation of bioprocesses. The notebooks will be updated with more explaining text gradually during the coming weeks. Earlier notes you find [here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Notes.md).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Colab. I also tailor-make models of biotechnical processes for your needs on a consultancy basis. Work with processes involves broader data analysis and is a part of my work, and simulation is just one tool, but an important one. Digital Twins is a catchword these days and that is also what I can do!
