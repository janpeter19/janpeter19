- 👋 Hi, I’m @janpeter19
- 👀 I’m interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications, see
[paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378889007_Design_ideas_behind_Bioprocess_Library_for_Modelica).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab. I have prepared several 
[examples](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Examples_used.md)
for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch. Here you follow a Jupyter notebook and can continue interact using Python and modifiy the simulations and graphs shown. More about the technology used
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Technology_used.md) and about the modelling 
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Modelling_used.md).
No installation needed! 

- **Note 2024-05-24**
Now PyFMI 2.13.0 is available again, as well as FMPy 0.3.20, for running the simulations in the notebooks.
Now Linux FMUs are updated to OpenModelica ver 1.23.0-dev. The FMUs are compiled with recently updated Bioprocess Library 2.2.0. The common command-line interactions for both PyFMI and FMPy is done with FMU-explore updated to 1.0.0. 

  Earlier notes you find [here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Notes.md).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Modelica in Colab. I also tailor-make models of biotechnical processes for your needs on a consultancy basis. Work with processes involves broader data analysis and is a part of my work, and simulation is just one tool, but an important one. Digital Twins is a catchword these days and part of what I do.
