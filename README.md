- 👋 Hi, I’m @janpeter19
- 👀 I’m interested in Modelica and especially biotechnical applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach out more using Google Colab. I have prepared several 
[examples](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Examples_used.md)
for you starting with the repository BPL_TEST2_Batch. Here you follow a Jupyter notebook and can continue interact using Python and modifiy the simulations and graphs shown. More about the technology used
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Technology_used.md) and about the modelling 
[here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Modelling_used.md).
No installation needed! 

- **Note 2023-03-30** Now the setup scripts including FMU-explore ver 0.9.7 has after a longer trial period matured and provide interface for both the package PyFMI and FMPy and almost identical notebooks can be used. The  different setup scripts for both packages  have very similar structure.  The difficulties to load PyFMI is now eliminated and was due to mismatch between Colab and Miniconda.   Colab now use Python 3.9 as default. Here are several new repositories in the pipe-line. Stay tuned!  Earlier notes you find [here](https://github.com/janpeter19/References/blob/main/Notes.md).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the examples of use of Colab. I also tailor-make models of biotechnical processes for your needs on a consultancey basis. Digital Twins is a catchword these days and that is what I do!
